Demo: https://boinfra.github.io/SelectionTool/

This demo demonstrates multiple use cases of the application:

1. Select object types and licenses, using a submit button
2. Select object types and licenses without submit button
3. Select only object types without submit button
4. Select object types without submit button, but only a few types are selected at the beginning

This is a sample HTML / JavaScript application that demonstrates how to use AngularJS to create a dynamic query building web UI.
